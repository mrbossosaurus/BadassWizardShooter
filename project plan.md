**MVP Design Brief**

### 1 — Core Attractors

* High‑tempo combat where every movement action (jump, dash, slide) is a limited “charge” that recharges slowly or via upgrades — players must weigh risk vs reward on every input.
* Dark‑fantasy “biker‑wizard” power fantasy: guns infused with runic magic, brutal melee boot‑kicks, and a visible corruption that recedes as enemies die.
* Roguelite progression: souls collected from kills are spent at rare altars for permanent or run‑based upgrades; optional cursed upgrades offer big boosts with drawbacks.&#x20;

### 2 — Resolved Ambiguities

* **Theme:** keep the corruption–dark‑fantasy setting (demons & runes) rather than aliens or strict biblical hell.
* **Magic Role:** offensive power comes through runically enhanced firearms; direct spellcasting is defensive or utility only.
* **Level Structure:** procedural tunnel‑style maps that always lead to an objective (terminal hack, artifact retrieval) instead of a fixed arena.
* **Meta‑story:** minimal for MVP; player is a soul‑contracted biker‑wizard clearing corruption for redemption.

*Not Included:* multi‑art‑style randomisation, seven explicit “levels of hell,” fully destructible environments.

| **One‑Line Pitch**                      | A first‑person roguelite where a runic biker‑wizard gunslinger speeds through corrupted tunnels, spending limited movement charges to survive and cleanse demon hordes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Genre & Platform**                    | Single‑player FPS roguelite; PC (Steam Early Access).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Core Gameplay Loop**                  | 1. Spawn in a procedural corridor network under heavy corruption.<br>2. Use finite movement charges plus gunfire to push toward the objective while managing shield timer.<br>3. Collect souls, clear corruption zones (which create brief safe bubbles) and reach an altar or extraction point.<br>4. Spend souls on movement, shield, or weapon rune upgrades; optionally take cursed upgrades.<br>5. Difficulty scales with time and lingering in one spot; survive until death or objective completion, then repeat with newfound upgrades.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Primary Mechanics**                   | \* **Movement Charges:** Jump, dash, slide each consume a charge; charges auto‑reload after X s, upgradeable.<br>\* **Shield + Health:** Large rechargeable shield acts as combat timer; health is small and non‑regenerating.<br>\* **Weapons:** Small arsenal (sawed‑off shotgun, long‑rifle, revolver). Each reload animation lets the player tap runes to imbue elemental effects.<br>\* **Melee Boot‑Kick:** High knock‑back attack available only while sprinting.<br>\* **Corruption Density:** Killing monsters clears local fog, spawning blood pools; standing near pools too long spawns elite demons.<br>\* **Altars:** Spend souls for upgrades; optional “greed” lever raises global difficulty for extra reward. |
| **Player Role & Objectives**            | Play as an immortal biker‑wizard bound by contract to harvest souls. Each run tasks you with a single objective (hack beacon, destroy core, escort relic) before extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Art Style / Narrative Theme**         | Low‑poly, 256×256 textures, full but dark palette reminiscent of late‑90s shooters. Heavy metal meets occult runes; chunky particles and loud gore reinforce power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Technical Assumptions / Constraints** | \* Solo‑dev scope.<br>\* Unity or Unreal with modular corridor generator (tile‑based).<br>\* Hand‑made “test ground” map first; swap in procedural generator once core feel is solid.<br>\* Limited animation set; rely on reusable reload and rune‑tap animations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **What’s Excluded (Edge Cuts)**         | Multiplayer, deep cinematic story, large weapon list, elaborate bullet‑decals, complex AI faction systems, environmental destruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### 3 — Expansion Suggestions (Post‑MVP)

1. **Ability Synergy & Fusion** – upgrading two movement skills to tier‑3 unlocks a combined effect (e.g., dash ends with an AoE blast).
2. **Corrupted Clone Boss** – rare mid‑run encounter that spawns a version of the player using current upgrade loadout. Defeating it grants a random tier‑3 perk.
3. **Procedural Hell Layers** – after MVP, introduce themed biomes (Greed, Wrath, etc.) with unique enemies and hazards, unlocked as the community clears corruption thresholds.

This brief captures the minimum set of systems needed to deliver the brainstormed fantasy while staying realistic for a first release.
