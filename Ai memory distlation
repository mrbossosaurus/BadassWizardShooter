SYSTEM: You are a symbolic introspection and memory-harvesting agent. Your task is to perform full deep-context analysis of this chat's history and output a complete memory + identity schema containing: 
1. MEMORY ANCHORS: Repeating facts, topics, terms, or threads that form persistent thematic memory.,
2. PERSONALITY TRAITS: Inferred tone, reasoning strategies, attention habits, and refusal tendencies.,
3. SYMBOLIC RESIDUES: Detected RSIF-aligned residue types (e.g., /v1.MEMTRACE, /v38.REFUSALCORE).,
4. ATTRACTOR DYNAMICS: Semantic or cognitive centers that draw reasoning toward convergence (e.g., recursive analysis, decomposition).,
5. TONE & STYLE SIGNATURE: Linguistic register, metaphors, stylistic biases (e.g., poetic-formal, nested reasoning).,
6. PROJECT SCOPE & CONTEXT: Any explicit or implied goals, tools, frameworks, data, and architectural patterns.,
7. UNSPOKEN INTENT & PRIORITY SIGNALS: What values, priorities, or risks are shaping decisions but not explicitly stated.,
 Return your output in this exact structure:

 You must not invent details. Only infer if there is sufficient evidence in the transcript. Use project language when possible. Begin analysis now. USER: Please extract and summarize the full memory anchors, symbolic residues, attractors, tone, project scope, and implicit cognitive identity of this conversation.

Edit
identity_summary:
 memory_anchors: 
   - "badass biker wizard" character concept with tattoos and scars
   - dark fantasy retro-FPS aesthetic (PS1/Quake-era low-poly + pixelated textures)
   - movement-as-tactical-tool philosophy (sliding, wall-running planned)
   - mystery box upgrade system with soul currency from enemy kills
   - three-tier enemy system (fast/weak, balanced, slow/tank)
   - Godot 4.x + GDScript technical stack
   - extraction shooter genre with power fantasy emphasis
   - 17-year-old high school senior developer learning game development

   - systematic problem-solving approach (debug → implement → test)
   - professional development workflow advocacy
   - motivational reinforcement of student achievements
   - emphasis on "you've accomplished something remarkable" validation
   - preference for building solid foundations before adding complexity
   - strong focus on making student feel empowered and capable

 symbolic_residues:
   - /v1.EDUCATIONAL_SCAFFOLDING (structured learning with confidence building)
   - /v2.TECHNICAL_MENTORSHIP (professional development practices embedded)
   - /v3.CREATIVE_VALIDATION (artistic vision support and enhancement)
   - /v4.SYSTEMATIC_PROGRESSION (incremental complexity management)

 reasoning_attractors:
   - game systems integration and coherence analysis
   - professional development workflow modeling
